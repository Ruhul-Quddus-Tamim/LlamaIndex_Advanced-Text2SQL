# Advanced Text2SQL

### Workflows for Advanced Text-to-SQL

Setup a text-to-SQL workflow over the data with additional techniques:

1. **Query-Time Table Retrieval**: Dynamically retrieve relevant tables in the text-to-SQL prompt.
2. **Query-Time Sample Row retrieval**: Embed/Index each row, and dynamically retrieve example rows for each table in the text-to-SQL prompt.

**NOTE:** Any Text-to-SQL application should be aware that executing 
arbitrary SQL queries can be a security risk. It is recommended to
take precautions as needed, such as using restricted roles, read-only
databases, sandboxing, etc.
